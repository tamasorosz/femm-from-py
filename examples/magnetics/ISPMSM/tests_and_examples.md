# Tests for the Electric Machine Torque Calculations

## Some tests that are also intended as an example which helps to represent the physics behind the simulations

This documentation serves a sum of examples which were calculated during the tests of the codebase. There are some
tricks and tips regarding the code and the physics and also the limitations are highlighted. The documentation is not
intended to cover all the physics behind the simulations. It assumes a basic knowledge in electric engineering. For a 
complete coverage refer to the Design of **Rotating Electrical Machines, Juha Pyrhönen, Tapani Jokinen, Valéria Hrabovcová, 
DOI:10.1002/9781118701591** or for hungarian speaking fellows **Villamos Gépek** series from **József Liska**.
